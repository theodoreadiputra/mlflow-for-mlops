# mlflow-for-mlops
MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the entire machine learning lifecycle. It essentially helps streamline the process of developing, testing, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models.

Here's a breakdown of what MLflow offers:

Tracking: Track experiments to record and compare different runs, including parameters and results. This allows you to analyze what worked well and what didn't across various model iterations.
Models: Package and manage machine learning models from various libraries. MLflow provides a standardized format for packaging models, making it easier to deploy them to different serving platforms.
Projects: Package your machine learning code in a reusable and reproducible way. This ensures your projects can be easily shared with other data scientists or transferred to production environments.
Overall, MLflow aims to improve the efficiency and organization of machine learning workflows for data scientists and MLOps teams.
